// swift-tools-version: 6.0
// Two libraries:
//
// * `CoreAIRunner` (DRAFT) — self-contained N-state engine on the low-level `CoreAI`
//   system framework only. ⚠️ authored on macOS 26.6, compile/verify on macOS 27 + Xcode 27.
// * `ZooFMProvider` — zoo LanguageBundles behind FoundationModels' `LanguageModelSession`
//   with tool calling + streaming. Depends on Apple's `coreai-models` package (product
//   `CoreAILM`): clone it AT THIS REPO'S ROOT and apply the patch stack, exactly like
//   `apps/` (see apps/README.md step 1). Verified on macOS 27 beta + Xcode 27 beta.
//
// swift build -c release      (release Xcode 27 (macOS 27 SDK) is the active toolchain — no DEVELOPER_DIR override needed (AB-A-0077, 2026-09-17))
