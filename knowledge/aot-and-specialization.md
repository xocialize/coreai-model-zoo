## What "specialization" is
A shipped `.aimodel` is a **source/device-agnostic** representation. To run it, the OS **specializes** it for
the *specific device + OS version*. Two transforms (324/326 verbatim):
1. a **core set of compilation steps** that segment, plan, and optimize compute — **this is where most of the latency is**;
2. **executable-artifact generation** for the compute units used — these artifacts are **tied to the device + OS version**.

The result is **cached**: first load pays the cost, later loads are fast. *"This process can take a significant
amount of time for very large models… avoid having model specialization occur within user-interactive flows."*

This is exactly this project's **re-specialization** finding: a *dynamic*-shape core re-specializes on every new
sequence length (~60–80× per-shape compile tax). (Project memories: `project_macos_speed_state`,
`reference_wwdc_coreai_sessions`; verbatim talks in `ondevice/_wwdc{324,326}_transcript.txt`.)

## Moving the cost off the interactive path (Swift API, 324 verbatim)
```swift
// 1) Check the cache; nil => not specialized yet => gate the feature / show "preparing…"
let cache = AIModelCache.default
guard let model = try cache.model(for: modelURL, options: .default) else {
    informUser("Preparing AI features. This may take a while…"); return
}

// 2) Or specialize explicitly, ahead of first use (after asset download / on opt-in)
try await AIModel.specialize(contentsOf: modelURL)
```
`AIModelCache` also: delete unused entries, control retention policy, and **share a cache across apps in one
app group**. `SpecializationOptions` configures how the model is optimized for inference (and, on macOS,
the preferred compute unit — see `runtime/_specialization_options.py`: `cpu_only()`, `default()`,
`from_preferred_compute_unit_kind(ComputeUnitKind.gpu()/.ane()/...)`). Article: *"Managing model
specialization and caching"*.

## Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation — shift the compile to your dev machine
The expensive **compilation** step can be done ahead of time on the dev machine, producing a **compiled
model**; the device then only finishes the (much smaller) device-specific specialization. 326 verbatim:
*"…do some of that compilation ahead-of-time on my development machine… there is now much less work to do
and finishes significantly faster… generates one or more compiled models targeting specific device
architectures… a background asset for each compiled model."*

### The 4B wall — large decoders MUST ship AOT, not as a portable IR
Small decoders (≤~1–2B, e.g. MiniCPM5-1B) ship as a portable `.aimodel` IR and specialize on-device
fine. A **4B** decoder does **not** — verified on `FastContext-1.0-4B` (Qwen3-4B), iPhone 17 Pro / iOS 27:
- a **macOS-tagged** IR has no iOS delegates to load → on-device load fails `NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=2`;
- an **iOS-tagged palettized** IR's on-device GPU specialization exhausts the device's scratch disk
  mid-compile → `LLVM ERROR: No space left on device` (a 4B graph's specialization scratch is huge).

So 4B-class GPU bundles must be **AOT-compiled per device class** and shipped as `.aimodelc`
(`xcrun coreai-build compile … --preferred-compute gpu --architecture h18p`) — the same reason the
Gemma-4B zoo bundle ships `…aotc_h18p`. **ANE is worse at this size:** the FastContext ANE bundle
static-loads (31 ANE regions, ~518 s cold) but the warmup **inference** dies with
`com.apple.appleneuralengine` / `ANECompilerService` `Code=4097` ("ANE compile failed"), so the GPU
AOT bundle is the only on-device path. (Source: `project_fastcontext_4b_coreai` on-device runs, 2026-06-27.)

### Tool naming — RESOLVED (corrects the earlier "aimodelc not coreai-build" note)
- **CLI command you invoke = `xcrun coreai-build compile`.** Confirmed: `models/README.md:157`
  (*"Run `xcrun coreai-build compile --help` for usage"*), `ModelBundle.swift:101`, WWDC 326 verbatim
  (*"done with the coreai-build command"*), Apple docs.
- **Output artifact + underlying binary = `aimodelc` / `.aimodelc`.** The compiled bundle is
  `modelName.architectureName.aimodelc` (`ModelBundle.swift:103`); the runner accepts `.aimodel` or
  `.aimodelc` (`LLMRunnerMain.swift:719-722`); and `aimodelc` exists as a binary in Xcode's toolchain
  (`Xcode.app/.../usr/bin/aimodelc`).
- So both names are real: **`coreai-build` = the verb, `aimodelc` = the compiler binary / compiled extension.**

### Flags (full surface, from `xcrun coreai-build compile --help`, verified 2026-06-10)
```
coreai-build compile <input.aimodel> [--output <dir>] [--platform iOS|macOS|watchOS|visionOS|tvOS ...]
    [--min-deployment-version 27.0] [--preferred-compute gpu|neural-engine|none]
    [--architecture <arch> ...] [--expect-frequent-reshapes]
```
- `--preferred-compute neural-engine|gpu` — pin the target compute unit. `neural-engine` is the concrete
  ANE-later lever (also the documented *fix* for "compiles but runs on CPU", `common_issues.md:112`); `gpu`
  pins the GPU `.aimodel` for the GPU track.
- `--expect-frequent-reshapes` — the CLI twin of `SpecializationOptions.expectFrequentReshapes` (the flag
  gemma4's 3-stage pipeline already needs); hint for dynamic/bucketed cores.
- Output: **one `.aimodelc` per device architecture**, named `base.<arch>.aimodelc`, each containing
  `main-<arch>.mlirb` + `main-<arch>-delegates`. Ship as **Background Assets**; app detects the device arch
  and requests the matching one (326). See "Compiling Core AI models ahead of time" + "Discover Apple-Hosted
  Background Assets".

### ⚠️ `expectFrequentReshapes` on a FIXED-shape graph kills the AOT bundle on iOS (device-validated 2026-07-23)
The hint is not free insurance — it is a request for a *reshape-tolerant* specialization. Ask for it at
load time on a graph whose shapes are all static and the runtime **stops using the AOT specialization and
compiles on device**, which on iPhone 17 Pro segfaults inside the MPSGraph AICode compiler:

```
EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV) … MPSGraphAICodeCompilerDelegate getInitializedAICodeBytecodeWithPayloadPrefix:
  → Compiler_coreAI.compile(moduleBytecode:to:with:) → libODIECompiler … CompileForDelegates
```
No error string, no partial output — the app just dies at `AIModel(contentsOf:options:)`.

- Found on VibeVoice (5 fixed-shape graphs: q=1 stateful decode + fixed-T decoder). `expectFrequentReshapes
  = true` → SIGSEGV on the first graph; `= false` → all 6 loads in 2.6 s, gate PASS.
- **Compiling the bundle with `--expect-frequent-reshapes` does NOT make the runtime hint safe** — both the
  plain and the reshape-hinted `.aimodelc` crash when the *runtime* asks for the hint. It is the load-time
  option that matters.
- Rule of thumb: `expectFrequentReshapes = true` only where the shapes really do change — dynamic query
  length / bucketed prefill (MinerU decode, spec-decode verify, gemma4's 3-stage pipeline). Static decode
  (`S=1`) and fixed-T vocoders must load **without** it.

### ⚠️ Architecture names track the DEVICE IDENTIFIER, not the marketing name (device-validated 2026-06-10)
The `--architecture` h-numbers follow the hardware **device-identifier major version** (`iPhone18,1`,
`Mac16,5`), NOT the marketing name ("iPhone 17 Pro", "M4 Max"):
- **iPhone 17 Pro = `iPhone18,1` → `h18p`.** An `h17p` `.aimodelc` pushed to it fails to load with
  `invalidCompiledModel`; the same model compiled `--architecture h18p` loads + runs (validated with the
  gemma4 int4km head, `AIModel(contentsOf:)` in CoreAIChat).
- **M4 Max Mac = `Mac16,x` → `h16c`.** Of all 20 macOS archs, only `h16c` loads in the Python runtime on an
  M4 Max (`ondevice/_aimodelc_head_check.py`); h17*/h16g/h16s all raise RuntimeError.
- **`coreai-build compile` EXITs 0 for ANY requested arch** — a successful compile does NOT validate the
  arch choice; only a device load does. (Earlier notes saying "h17p for iPhone 17 Pro" were name-matching,
  unvalidated — corrected here.)
- The same check also proved: a custom-Metal-kernel (`TorchMetalKernel`) model **survives AOT** — the
  `.aimodelc`'s `specialized_model_*.mpsgraph` contains the full `[[kernel]]` MSL signature + compiled MTLB
  in `resources.bin`, and the compiled asset's outputs are **bit-identical** to the source `.aimodel`.

### Deployment shape (326 demo)
Bundle the models out of the app download (they add >1 GB); gate the download behind a first-run feature
intro; **download assets → kick off specialization (with AOT already done) → fast first inference**, all off
the interactive flow. Subsequent inferences use the cached specialized asset.

## Status / caveats for this project (verified vs inferred)
- ✅ **AOT now WORKS on the beta — the toolchain-skew blocker (B2) is RESOLVED.** Verified end-to-end
  2026-06-10 (Xcode `27A5194q`, Metal Toolchain `v27.1.5194.15` / `metal 32023.917`, macOS 27.0 26A5353q):
  `xcrun coreai-build compile tiny.aimodel --platform macOS` → **EXIT 0**, 20 per-arch `.aimodelc`
  (`h13c…h17s`); `--platform iOS --preferred-compute neural-engine` → **EXIT 0**, 8 `.aimodelc`
  (`h13g h14g h15g h16g h16p h17g h17p h18p`). So AOT is testable on the real cores now — biggest open lever.
- ✅ **AOT avoids the first-run-compile OOM that forced chunking — DEVICE-PROVEN for LOAD (2026-06-10).**
  The un-chunked **35-layer monolith** (`gemma4_e2b_hostcache_L35_int8.aimodel`, 1.8 GB = the size class
  whose on-device ANE first-run compile jetsam'd) compiled `--platform iOS --preferred-compute
  neural-engine --architecture h18p` (EXIT 0, ~4.0 GB host RSS; the `.aimodelc` embeds a pre-compiled
  MPSGraph executable) **loads on the iPhone 17 Pro with `cu=ane` in 6.5–8.1 s, NO jetsam** (avail
  6130→~2810 MB; two independent sessions). So the chunk-forcing constraint is gone at load time.
  **But EXECUTE is where it now dies (2nd measurement, picker session): the first inference step is
  jetsam-SIGKILLed** — load ✅ / run ❌. The load leaves only ~2.8 GB headroom (the GPU path leaves
  ~6.0 GB for the same-size core) and the first-step working set blows through it. Open levers:
  (1) drop the co-resident GPU head-argmax kernel (that test paired the ANE core with the GPU head) —
  retry with the on-ANE argmax head; (2) the tested monolith is the macOS-COMPOSITE authoring, not the
  fp16-hardened iOS-primitive authoring (Conv2d 1×1 + LayerNorm-trick RMSNorm) the working ANE chunks
  use — re-author + re-test; (3) the compile emits an MPSGraph delegate even with `neural-engine`
  preferred. For comparison, the **GPU** monoliths fully work AOT'd: the int4-kernel `.aimodelc`
  (1.9 GB) cold-loads + verifies 8/8; the int8-kernel `.aimodelc` measured a clean first-load A/B —
  **4.9 s vs 19.2 s for the plain `.aimodel`'s true-cold specialize (~4×; post cache-wipe), warm 0.0 s
  both** (the OS cache serves `.aimodelc` too).
- ❌ **The 6 host-cache chunk graphs CANNOT be AOT-compiled — `coreai-build` itself SIGSEGVs** (host-side
  `ANECompilerOffline::~ANECompilerOffline → objc_release`, inside MPSGraph's `anePreCompileBinary`;
  ~0.9 s in, all 6 chunks, both archs; the L35 monolith from the same authoring compiles fine — beta
  compiler bug, size/shape-correlated). So the chunked-ANE path gets **no AOT first-load relief**; AOT
  applies to monolith artifacts only for now.
- **int4 head differs BY compute unit (resolved):** k-means palettization is `F.linear`-only, so the GPU
  int4-class head = a **fused-int8 Metal kernel** (GPU-only, [`custom-metal-kernels.md`](custom-metal-kernels.md)).
  The **ANE** can't run that MSL → its low-bit head path is **int4 per-output-channel *quantization* on a
  Conv2d head** (coreai-opt quant, not palettization) and/or **vocab pruning**, or split the head to the GPU.
- **The official iOS ANE stateful decode is blocked by the SAME KV-write bug** — Apple's own
  `KVCacheHandler` (`primitives/ios/cache.py`) uses the data-tensor `in_step` write that SIGSEGV/SIGTRAPs the
  beta (verified on GPU; device-ANE fails MLIR lowering). So ANE-later genuinely waits on the Apple fix
  (FB23024751); it is not a self-inflicted pattern. Apple's own skill even prescribes the **readonly-KV-I/O**
  (host-cache) pattern as the fix for stateful-reset (`common_issues.md:145-148`) — i.e. host-cache is an
  Apple-acknowledged workaround, not a hack.
- The ANE-later goal (~34 tok/s class) bundles three things: (1) **stateful KV** (blocked by the KV-write
  SIGSEGV — [`coreai-beta-mpsgraph-kvwrite-bug.md`](coreai-beta-mpsgraph-kvwrite-bug.md), memory
  `project_ane_vs_gpu_premise`), (2) **int4 / vocab-pruned head** (resolved above + [`compression-reference.md`](compression-reference.md)),
  (3) **AOT** (now unblocked ✅).
